Kextraction documentation
=======================================

   This project is under active development.
   This codes have been under development with the aim to help study the wave interaction and frature of the MIZ in the arctic pole.
   It offers the opportunity to extract the local wavenumber k from a 2D field of waves propagating on a medium. 
   
   * To use this project, check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information.
   * Some information on the algorithm of Fast Checkerboard Demodulation are available in :doc:`FCD`
   * To learn how to use the extraction of k, check out the :doc:`kextraction` section.
